## Acknowledgements

First, I would like to thank everyone who made the work described here possible by making their work public:

- RikusW, who published his results on [reverse engineering the debugWIRE protocol](https://web.archive.org/web/20240614191418/http://www.ruemohr.org/docs/debugwire.html),
- [dcbrown](https://github.com/dcwbrown), who wrote [dwire-debug](https://github.com/dcwbrown/dwire-debug), a debugger using only an USB-UART converter. I was never able to get it running on my Mac, but it provided me with a lot of important information.
- [DeqingSun](https://github.com/DeqingSun) who was the first one to integrate the open-source debugWIRE GDB server [dwire-debug](https://github.com/dcwbrown/dwire-debug) into the Arduino IDE 2,
- [wholder](https://github.com/wholder), wo wrote the Uno-based debugger [DebugWireDebuggerProgrammer](https://github.com/wholder/DebugWireDebuggerProgrammer),
- [jdolinay](https://github.com/jdolinay), who wrote the GDB remote stub for AVRs [avr_debug](https://github.com/jdolinay/avr_debug),
- [MCUdude](https://github.com/MCUdude), who is the author of [MiniCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MiniCore) and [MicroCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MicroCore), and
- [SpenceKonde](https://github.com/SpenceKonde), who is the author of [ATTinyCore](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore).

Of course, my thanks go also to everybody else, who contributed to the Arduino project.


Last, but not least, I would like to thank everybody who contributed to dw-link:

- [kristianwiklund](https://github.com/kristianwiklund), and
- [MikeChen08](https://github.com/MikeChen08).
