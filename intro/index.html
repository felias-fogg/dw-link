<p>Before we start the excursion into the world of debugging, some background on the <a href="#the-debugwire-interface">debugWIRE interface</a> is provided, sketching the physical properties of the debugWIRE protocol. Then we survey <a href="#other-debugging-approaches-for-classic-attinys-and-atmegax8s">other open-source approaches to debugging classic AVR MCUs</a></p>
<p>With that out of the way, we have a look at what we need on the hardware side.  You need an Arduino UNO (or something equivalent) as the <a href="../requirements/#the-hardware-debugger">hardware debugger</a> and a <a href="../requirements/#mcus-with-debugwire-interface">chip or board that understands debugWIRE</a>, i.e., a classic ATtiny or an ATmegaX8. Then, you only have to <a href="../installation/#firmware-installation">install the debugger firmware on the UNO</a> and <a href="../installation/#setting-up-the-hardware">set up the hardware for a debugging session</a>. Finally, you need to <a href="../installation/#setting-up-the-debugging-software">install a debugging environment</a> and then you can <a href="../debugging/">start debugging</a>. </p>
<p>If you have performed all the above steps, then the setup should look like as in the following picture.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felias-fogg/dw-link/refs/heads/master/docs/pics/debugger-setup.png" alt="hardware debugger setup" width="70%" />
</p>

<p>Your development machine, the <em>host</em>, is connected to the UNO acting as a <em>hardware debugger</em> over the usual USB connection. The  two devices use the <em>GDB remote serial protocol</em> to communicate with each other. The hardware debugger in turn is connected to the <em>target system</em>, whereby the <em>debugWIRE protocol</em> is used for communication. </p>
<p>The physical connection between the hardware debugger and the target, as described in the <a href="../installation/#setting-up-the-hardware">section about the hardware setup</a>, is something that might need some enhancements. Instead of six jumper wires, you may want to have a more durable connection. This is covered in the part about <a href="../better/"><em>a better hardware debugger</em></a>. Finally, <a href="../problems/">possible problems</a> and <a href="../troubleshooting/">troubleshooting</a> is covered.</p>
<p>And what do you with your hardware debugger once you have debugged all your programs and they work flawlessly? Since version 2.2.0, you can use dw-link also as an STK500 v1 ISP programmer. If you connect to dw-link with 19200 bps and start avrdude, then dw-link becomes an ISP programmer.</p>
<h2 id="the-debugwire-interface">The debugWIRE interface</h2>
<p>The basic idea of debugWIRE is that the RESET line is used as a communication line between the target system (the system you want to debug) and the hardware debugger, which in turn can then communicate with the development machine or host, which runs a debug program such as GDB. The idea of using only a single line that is not used otherwise is very cool because it does not waste any of the other pins for debugging purposes (as does, e.g., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG">JTAG interface</a>). However, using the RESET line as a communication channel means, of course, that one cannot use the RESET line to reset the MCU anymore. Furthermore, one cannot any longer use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-system_programming">ISP programming</a> to upload new firmware to the MCU or change the fuses of the MCU. </p>
<p>With respect to the debugWIRE protocol there are basically three states your MCU could be in:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>normal</strong> <strong>state</strong> in which the DWEN (debugWIRE enable) <a href="https://microchipdeveloper.com/8avr:avrfuses">fuse</a> is disabled. In this state, you can use ISP programming to change fuses and to upload programs. By enabling the DWEN fuse, one reaches the <strong>transitional</strong> <strong>state</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>transitional</strong> <strong>state</strong> is the state in which the DWEN fuse is enabled. In this state, you could use ISP programming to disable the DWEN fuse again, to reach the <strong>normal state</strong>. By <em>power-cycling</em> (switching the target system off and on again), one reaches the <strong>debugWIRE</strong> <strong>state</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>debugWIRE</strong> <strong>state</strong> is the state in which you can use the debugger to control the target system. If you want to return to the <strong>normal</strong> <strong>state</strong>, a particular debugWIRE command leads to the <strong>transitional state</strong>, from which one can reach the <strong>normal state</strong> using ordinary ISP programming by disabling the DWEN fuse.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="state-dia" src="../pics/statediag.png" /></p>
<p>The hardware debugger will take care of bringing you from <em>normal</em> state to <em>debugWIRE</em> state when you type  the command <code>monitor debugwire enable</code> . In fact, when using the Arduino IDE 2, this will be done in the background for you. After the hardware debugger has enabled the DWEN fuse, the system LED will flash in a particular pattern, which signals that you should power-cycle the target. Further, in the GDB debugger, a message will be shown that asks you to power-cycle the target system. If the hardware debugger powers the target, it will power-cycle automatically. This transition is only necessary once. The next time, when you start a debugging session, the target system is already in the debugWIRE state and nothing needs to be done. </p>
<p>When you are done with debugging and you want to get the target system back into the normal state, you must type the command <code>monitor debugwire disable</code> just before exiting the debugger.</p>
<h2 id="other-debugging-approaches-for-classic-attinys-and-atmegax8s">Other debugging approaches for classic ATtinys and ATmegaX8s</h2>
<p>While dw-link is (unsurprisingly) one of my preferred open source solution for debugging classic tiny AVRs and ATmegaX8s, there are a number of other possible solutions. </p>
<p><a href="https://bloom.oscillate.io/">Bloom</a> is not a hardware debugger, but it is a pretty extensive implementation of a gdbserver for almost all AVR MCUs using the Microchip hardware debuggers. The only drawback is that it runs only under Linux. Similarly, <a href="https://github.com/avrdudes/avarice">avarice</a> is another such gdbserver. Recently, I added another gdbserver to the mix, which is written in Python: <a href="https://github.com/felias-fogg/dw-gdbserver">dw-gdbserver</a>. </p>
<p>There exists a software simulator called <a href="https://github.com/buserror/simavr">SIMAVR</a> and there is a <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Remote-Stub.html">GDB remote stub</a> for some ATmegas, called <a href="https://github.com/jdolinay/avr_debug">avr_debug</a>. Both are integrated into <a href="https://platformio.org/">PlatformIO</a> as debuggers. However, both tools come with a lot of restrictions and using them is not the same as debugging on the hardware where your firmware should finally run. </p>
<p>Based on RikusW's work on <a href="http://www.ruemohr.org/docs/debugwire.html">reverse engineering the debugWIRE protocol</a>, you can find a few attempts at building debuggers using debugWIRE. First, there is an implementation called <a href="https://github.com/dcwbrown/dwire-debug">dwire-debug</a> for host systems that uses only the serial line interface to talk with a target using the debugWIRE interface. This program implements GDB's remote serial protocol.  Unfortunately, the particular way of turning a serial interface into a one-wire interface did not work for me on a Mac. This approach has been further developed, resulting in an interesting solution for <a href="https://github.com/DeqingSun/unoDebugTestPackage">debugging Arduino UNOs using a CH552 board</a>. </p>
<p>Then there is also an Arduino UNO based hardware debugger called <a href="https://github.com/wholder/DebugWireDebuggerProgrammer">DebugWireDebuggerProgrammer</a>. However, it does not provide an interface for GDB's remote serial protocol. On top of that, all these solutions allow only one breakpoint (the hardware breakpoint of debugWIRE).</p>
<p>There exists an implementation similar to dwire-debug in Pascal called <a href="https://github.com/ccrause/debugwire-gdb-bridge">debugwire-gdb-bridge</a> that appears to be more complete. In particular, it handles multiple breakpoints. However, I was not able to install it. That is probably based on the fact that my knowledge of Pascal is rusty and I have no experience with the Lazarus IDE. </p>
<p>I took all of the above ideas (and some of the code) and put it together in order to come up with a cheap debugWIRE hardware debugger supporting GDB's remote serial protocol. Actually, it was a bit more than just throwing things together. I developed a <a href="https://github.com/felias-fogg/SingleWireSerial">new library for single wire serial communication</a> that is <a href="https://hinterm-ziel.de/index.php/2021/10/30/one-line-only/">much more reliable and robust</a> than the usually employed SoftwareSerial library. Further, I fixed a few loose ends in the existing implementations, sped up communication and flash programming, supported slow MCU clocks, implemented an <a href="https://hinterm-ziel.de/index.php/2022/01/02/thats-one-small-step-for-a-man-one-giant-leap-for-a-debugger-on-single-stepping-and-interrupts/">interrupt-safe way of single-stepping</a>, and spent a few nights debugging the debugger.  And I tested the debugger on almost all MCUs supported by <a href="https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore">ATTinyCore</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MCUdude/MicroCore">MicroCore</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/MCUdude/MiniCore">MiniCore</a>. Along the way, I also made <a href="https://hinterm-ziel.de/index.php/2021/12/29/surprise-surprise/">a number of interesting discoveries</a>.</p>
